I am currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [Cambridge Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Mateja Jamnik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/index.html). My research interest primarily lies in the explainability of artificial intelligence (XAI), and my current research projects mainly focus on developing interpretable foundation models for structured tabulr data, especially for real-world healthcare application.

Before joining Cambridge, I received my BEng in Computer Science and Technology from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to work as a research intern under the supervision of [Prof. Si Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/siliuhome/) at [Cola Laboratory](https://colalab.net/).

If you are also passionate about XAI or you would like to discuss anything interesting with me, please feel free to reach out via: **silencejiang12138 \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com**
