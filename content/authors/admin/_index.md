<div style="text-align: justify;">

I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Cambridge Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Mateja Jamnik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mj201/index.html) and <nobr>[Prof. Nikola Simidjievski](https://simidjievskin.github.io/)</nobr>. My research interest primarily lies in the structured tabular data and explainability of artificial intelligence (XAI), where my research projects mainly focus on:

* tabular foundation models
* tabular generative modelling
* trustworthy AI solutions for scientific applications

Before joining Cambridge, I was fortunate to work as a research intern on embodied AI at [MT Lab](https://mtlab.meitu.com/en/?lang=en) and [Cola Laboratory](https://colalab.net/) under the supervision of [Prof. Si Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/siliuhome/).

üôå If you would like to discuss anything related to XAI, please feel free to reach out via: `silencejiang12138 [at] gmail [dot] com`.
